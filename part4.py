Reminder: The triangle inequality theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.

The function possibletriangle will take 3 integer arguments(NOT as a list), each representing a side length of a triangle. Define possible triangle so that it returns the Boolean value True if the 3 sides make a possible triangle, and False if the 3 sides cannot be the sides of a triangle.

Two examples of what this function should do (not necessarily what will appear on the console):

possibletriangle(7, 5, 2)
--> False                       #the result returned is the Boolean value False(not the string "False")

possibletriangle(8, 12, 13)
--> True                        #the result returned is the Boolean value True(not the string "True")
